New PMM would become the \"system of truth\" for this MA# and provide to all systems.\n\nToday there are many challenges since NPI cannot be used to uniquely identify a provider but it is the primary Provider ID on a claim.  The issue is that Providers decide how they want to get paid BUT they don't get NPIs to follow in accordance with how they want to get paid (by location or specialty).  No standard put forth by CMS that can be enforced by the States.  Medicaid wants to pay Providers the way they want to be paid even though the NPI may not be aligned with this approach.\n\nCurrent Claims processing approach:\n1) If NPI has a 1:1 match with MA# then claim pays\n2)  If NPI has 1:M match with MA# then check the check dates of services and the state \n3)  If not match still then check zip codes (first 5 digits).  Last resort check the 4 digits after Zip to narrow to the right MA#\n\nFields also include Previous Provider Number and New Provider Number",
